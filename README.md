# hello-world
Repository created to learn how this works

This repository was created 2015 November 3rd, following the "hello-world" tutorial recommended by GitHub webpage to know and learn how this stuff works. 

The main reason to open an account in GitHub is the cours that I'm following into Coursera: "The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox".

Thus, I hope to learn how this thing works and learn a lot of about data science in that online course.
